### 进程和线程的基本概念

#### 进程

- 是资源分配和调度的基本单位
- 是线程的容器
- 进程间的通信方式 #深入

    - 它的数据空间的独立性决定了它的通信相对比较复杂，需要通过操作系统。
    通信方式
    - 管道
    - 信号量
        - 信号量是一个计数器，可以用来控制多个进程对共享资源的访问。它常作为一种锁机制，防止某进程正在访问共享资源时，其他进程也访问该资源。因此，主要作为进程间以及同一进程内不同线程之间的同步手段。
    - 消息队列
    - 消息队列是由消息的链表，存放在内核中并由消息队列标识符标识。消息队列克服了信号传递信息少、管道只能承载无格式字节流以及缓冲区大小受限等缺点。
    - 共享内存
        - 共享内存就是映射一段能被其他进程所访问的内存，这段共享内存由一个进程创建，但多个进程都可以访问。
    - 套接字

#### 线程

- 是程序执行的最小单位
- 各个线程共享进程的地址空间和资源
- 通信方式
    - 由于多线程共享地址空间和数据空间，所以多个线程间的通信是一个线程的数据可以直接提供给其他线程使用，而不必通过操作系统。
    - 但是也正因此（这些线程都能访问相同的变量），我们需要有一种比进程间数据共享力度更细的数据共享机制，如果没有，线程对资源的同时访问将会造车不可预测的结果。
- 为了实现CPU的高利用率，同一进程的线程被设计省可以在不同的CPU上运行


### 进程带来的问题

#### 安全问题（safety）

特指数据安全，被共享的对象，在多线程的交替操作下会导致不可预料的结果。

``` java 

public class SharedObject {

    private int value;

    public void setValue() {
        this.value++;
    } 
 }

```
value++: there are 3 operations here: read the value, add one to it, and write out the new value. 
Since operations in multiple threads may be arbitrarily interleaved by the runtime, it is possible for two threads to read the value at the same time, both see the same value, and then both add one to it. The result is that the same sequence number is returned from multiple calls in different threads, which is not our desired results(should be 3 instead).
A: get 1 -> 1 + 1 =2 -> value = 2
B: --------->get 1 ---> 1 + 1 =2 -> value = 2

 Threads share the same memory address space and run concurrently, they can access or modify variables that other threads might be using. 
 
 This is a tremendous convenience, because it makes data sharing much easier than would other inter-thread communications mechanisms. 
 
 But it is also a significant risk: threads can be confused by having data change unexpectedly. Allowing multiple threads to access and modify the same variables introduces an element of nonsequentiality into an otherwise sequential programming model, which can be confusing and difficult to reason about. 
 
 For a multithreaded program’s behavior to be predictable, access to shared variables must be properly coordinated so that threads do not interfere with one another.

#### 活跃性问题（Liveness）

While safety means “nothing bad ever happens”, liveness concerns the com- plementary goal that “something good eventually happens”.

A liveness failure occurs when an activity gets into a state such that it is permanently unable to make forward progress. One form of liveness failure that can occur in sequential programs is an inadvertent infinite loop, where the code that follows the loop never gets executed.

The use of threads introduces additional liveness risks. For example, if thread A is waiting for a resource that thread B holds exclusively, and B never releases it, A will wait forever. Chapter 10 describes various forms of liveness failures and how to avoid them, including deadlock, star- vation, and livelock. 

#### 性能问题（Performance）


In well designed concurrent applications the use of threads is a net perfor- mance gain, but threads nevertheless carry some degree of runtime overhead. 

Context switches—when the scheduler suspends the active thread temporarily so another thread can run—are more frequent in applications with many threads, and have significant costs: saving and restoring execution context, loss of locality, and CPU time spent scheduling threads instead of running them. 

When threads share data, they must use synchronization mechanisms that can inhibit compiler optimizations, flush or invalidate memory caches, and create synchronization traffic on the shared memory bus. All these factors introduce additional performance costs.
