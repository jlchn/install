### thread pool defination

```java
  /**
     * Creates a new {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} with the given initial
     * parameters and default thread factory and rejected execution handler.
     * It may be more convenient to use one of the {@link Executors} factory
     * methods instead of this general purpose constructor.
     *
     * @param corePoolSize the number of threads to keep in the pool, even
     *        if they are idle, unless {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} is set
     * @param maximumPoolSize the maximum number of threads to allow in the
     *        pool
     * @param keepAliveTime when the number of threads is greater than
     *        the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads
     *        will wait for new tasks before terminating.
     * @param unit the time unit for the {@code keepAliveTime} argument
     * @param workQueue the queue to use for holding tasks before they are
     *        executed.  This queue will hold only the {@code Runnable}
     *        tasks submitted by the {@code execute} method.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if one of the following holds:<br>
     *         {@code corePoolSize < 0}<br>
     *         {@code keepAliveTime < 0}<br>
     *         {@code maximumPoolSize <= 0}<br>

### other thread pool

- newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor
    - like crontab
- newScheduledThreadPool
    - like crontab

### RejectedExecutionException and RejectedExceptionHander

If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached, the exception thrown and is handled by the current RejectedExecutionHandler.

the predefined handlers are listed below, AbortPolicy is the default policy all executors use. we can also have our own handler by implements RejectedExecutionHandler. 

``` java 
   /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that throws a
     * {@code RejectedExecutionException}.
     */
    public static class AbortPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates an {@code AbortPolicy}.
         */
        public AbortPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Always throws RejectedExecutionException.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         * @throws RejectedExecutionException always
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task " + r.toString() +
                                                 " rejected from " +
                                                 e.toString());
        }
    }

    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that silently discards the
     * rejected task.
     */
    public static class DiscardPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code DiscardPolicy}.
         */
        public DiscardPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Does nothing, which has the effect of discarding task r.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
        }
    }

    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that discards the oldest unhandled
     * request and then retries {@code execute}, unless the executor
     * is shut down, in which case the task is discarded.
     */
    public static class DiscardOldestPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code DiscardOldestPolicy} for the given executor.
         */
        public DiscardOldestPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Obtains and ignores the next task that the executor
         * would otherwise execute, if one is immediately available,
         * and then retries execution of task r, unless the executor
         * is shut down, in which case task r is instead discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                e.getQueue().poll();
                e.execute(r);
            }
        }
    }

      /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that runs the rejected task
     * directly in the calling thread of the {@code execute} method,
     * unless the executor has been shut down, in which case the task
     * is discarded.
     */
    public static class CallerRunsPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code CallerRunsPolicy}.
         */
        public CallerRunsPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Executes task r in the caller's thread, unless the executor
         * has been shut down, in which case the task is discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                r.run();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### ThreadFactory

ThreadFactory is used to create the threads and put to the queue.

``` java
interface ThreadFactory{
    Thread newThread(Runable r);
}
```
if we want to trace the thread creation by adding some logs, or we want to change the thread name, or we want to set threads as deamon, we can provide our own ThreadFactory.
