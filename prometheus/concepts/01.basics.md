### data model
#### metric and time series

`metric` is the measurement of a particular characteristic of a programs performance or efficiency.

A `time series` is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time.

> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series

each time series is called a metric and identified by a `metric name` and several `labels`(in form of key-value pairs) 
```
<metric name>{<label name>=<label value>, ...}
```

#### jobs and instances

In Prometheus terms, an endpoint you can scrape is called an instance, usually corresponding to a single process. A collection of instances with the same purpose is called a job

```
job: api-server
instance 1: 1.2.3.4:5670
instance 2: 1.2.3.4:5671
instance 3: 5.6.7.8:5670
instance 4: 5.6.7.8:5671
```
#### automatically generated labels and time series

When Prometheus scrapes a target, it attaches some labels automatically to the scraped time series which serve to identify the scraped target
- job: The configured job name that the target belongs to.
- instance: The <host>:<port> part of the target's URL that was scraped.

### metric types

#### Counter

represent a  monotonically increasing counter(单调递增计数器) whose value can only increase or be reset to zero after restart.

#### Guage
A gauge is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.

Gauges are typically used for measured values like temperatures or current memory usage

#### Histogram
A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. Buckets are used to count how many times event value was less than or equal to the specific bucket’s value.

A histogram with a base metric name of <basename> exposes multiple time series during a scrape

 - counters for each bucket, exposed as <basename>_bucket{le="<upper inclusive bound>"}
 - a counter for a sum of event values, exposed as <basename>_sum
 - counts number of events that happened, exposed as <basename>_count (identical to <basename>_bucket{le="+Inf"} above)
  
usages

Imagine we have a histogram named `http_request_duration_seconds` with 5 buckets with values: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5. 

3 requests come in with durations 1s, 2s, 3s. Then we would see below, attention how each value falls into the buckets.

```
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 0
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1"} 1
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="2"} 2
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="3"} 3
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="5"} 3
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 3
http_request_duration_seconds_sum 6
http_request_duration_seconds_count 3
```
calculate the average duration during the last 5m

```
http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m] / http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m]
```

calculate the SLA(requests less than 300ms)

```
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.3"}[5m])
/
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])
  ```

calculate the quantile

```
# 所有数值由小到大排列后第50%的数字
histogram_quantile(0.5, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[10m])
```

#### Summary

A Summary is like a histogram_quantile() function, but percentiles are computed in the client. Summary is made of a count and sum counters (like in Histogram type) and resulting quantile values.

For example, we want to find 0.5, 0.9, 0.99 quantiles and the same 3 requests with 1s, 2s, 3s durations come in.

```
http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 2
http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} 3
http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"} 3
http_request_duration_seconds_sum 6
http_request_duration_seconds_count 3
```

#### Summary and Histgram

The essential difference between summaries and histograms is that summaries calculate streaming φ-quantiles on the client side and expose them directly, while histograms expose bucketed observation counts and the calculation of quantiles from the buckets of a histogram happens on the server side using the histogram_quantile() function
